I think that this name was picked based on what we documented here https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html which I think makes sense:\r\n\r\n> - What is “Spark ML”?\r\n> \r\n>   “Spark ML” is not an official name but occasionally used to refer to the MLlib DataFrame-based API. This is majorly due to the org.apache.spark.ml Scala package name used by the DataFrame-based API, and the “Spark ML Pipelines” term we used initially to emphasize the pipeline concept.",
