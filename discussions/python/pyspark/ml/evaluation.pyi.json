Having keyword only arguments would be great, but we'll still have to do something to capture arguments.\r\n\r\nAlso, `keyword_only` has been used in the wild, though maybe not at the large scale.\r\n\r\nOverall I was thinking about:\r\n\r\n- Marking `__init__` and `setParams` with keyword only, primarily to make things explicit.\r\n- Preserving `keyword_only` for the time being.",
