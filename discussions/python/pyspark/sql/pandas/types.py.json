        "body" : "Note: these conversion functions are because pyarrow expects map items as a list of (key, value) pairs, and has this format when converting to Pandas also. The reason is that the arrow spec could allow for duplicate key values in a row, and doesn't say how these should be handled exactly. So by having these conversions, we match the non-arrow behavior for maps, with a dictionary as input/output.",
