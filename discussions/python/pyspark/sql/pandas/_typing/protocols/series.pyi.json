        "body" : "Oh... That's a tricky question. Let me provide some context...\r\n\r\nIn general this protocols exist not so much to annotate Pandas interfaces, but rather to make our side more robust. Initially, I just type ignored Pandas and was pretty satisfied about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I missed that on the way, it resulted in a situation, where ignore swallowed all the errors. Since Pandas-related are quite complex and it is easy to make a mistake I introduced this thingy.\r\n\r\nSo what can be done here:\r\n\r\n- Removing protocols and going back to `type: ignore`. To be honest, I am not very fond of that idea, but I see why you're concerned.\r\n- Creating a transient package that will fill the hole we have here.\r\n- Trying to convince good Pandas folks to take a leap [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/28142) :)\r\n",

        "body" : "One argument for keeping this as-is, is that it is primarily an internal type checking feature. It is not exposed in a way that can be used by the final user (though I thought about it in the past). \r\n\r\nThought it might be an argument against keeping it in the first place.\r\n\r\nOne more option is to extract both Pandas annotations from source just for the use in CI pipeline, until typed version is released. This will ensure consistency on our side.",
