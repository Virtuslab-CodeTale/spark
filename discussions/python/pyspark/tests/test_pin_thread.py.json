        "body" : "Yeah, agree. I don't think there's kind of a consistent rule for that. I usually just write comments when the contents are not directly related to the description of the class or method. e.g.) \"this class contains tests blah blah\" -> docstring, \"this test class don't use something because blah blah\" -> comments . But I guess it's just me :-).\r\n\r\n\r\nActually I don't bother docstrings often in test classes because it's unlikely the docstrings in class are read via pydoc (e.g., `help(PinThreadTests)` in Python shall) or generated as a doc.\r\n\r\n",
