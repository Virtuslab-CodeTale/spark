        "body" : "I needed to add this concrete base implementation here, otherwise the abstract override of close() in the trait didn't work in SparkExecuteStatementOperation, because it didn't have a concrete implementation in any of the subclasses.\r\nOn the other hand, if I wanted to implement it concretely in the trait, it was complaining about not being able to call protected methods from Java class in the trait.\r\n\r\nThis base implementation here is doing what it was doing in all the operations we have.\r\nIt might have been another tiny bug that SparkExecuteStatementOperation did not call cleanupOperationLog. The other operations did via their super call.",
