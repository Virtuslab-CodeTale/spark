        "body" : "I removed the assert because the refactoring moved that state into a location that is not easily accessible.  From reading the test and the comments around it the purpose of the test is to verify that the particular case did not result in an exception. The purpose of the assertion was to verify that the internal state was what they expected. I felt that the assert was unnecessary, but if you want me to add it back in I can refactor the code further and do so.  ",
