I think it's also something to be fixed (I'd rather want to see path being truncated with ellipses (...) instead of not adding and leaving it as it is.) but it's more likely bigger fix which may worth another fix instead of test fix.\n\nIf you meant counting the number of paths or something for edge-case, dealing with another UT would be easier, like we could simply add edge-cases there in this PR.
