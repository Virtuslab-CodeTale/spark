Some of them that related the Hive Metastore connection(never change it spark runtime), e.g. `hive.metastore.uris`, are clearly global static and unchangeable but displayable I guess. Some of the ones that might be related to, for example, the output codec/compression, preset in Hadoop/hive config files like `core-site.xml` shall bestill changeable from case to case, table to table, file to file, etc. So, it's meaningful to show the defaults for users to change based on that.\r\n",
