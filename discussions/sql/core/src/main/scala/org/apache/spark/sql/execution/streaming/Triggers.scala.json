Since we are refactoring this, lets make sure things move in the right direction and improve consistency. My opinion on where we should ideally be is \r\n- Minimize number of public classes that the user needs to know about. That means that ideally there NOT should be multiple public classes and ways for specifying a type of trigger. So there is should be only `Trigger.ProcessingTime` and `ProcessingTimeTrigger` should be hidden.\r\n- Classes that we dont want public visibility should not be visible in Java as well. Making it `public[sql]` still keeps it visible as a top-level in Java API docs. Either move the implementation inside the Trigger class, or move the `ProcessingTimeTrigger` into `sql/execution` package which is explicitly hidden from API docs.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for missing prior context and conversation. This is just my two cents. I am sure I am probably missing some aspect of the conversation. ",

        "body" : "My suggestion is we follow the comment above by moving `OneTimeTrigger` too, and leave it there. That's more consistent, and consistent with the intent. This leaves the class potentially 'public' in the bytecode, but it was before, and that's true of lots of `private[spark]` classes anyway. While I wouldn't argue with further moving things to `sql/execution`, I think that just putting the implementations in their natural home right now sounds coherent and an improvement, and doesn't expand the change much.",

        "body" : "Sorry I guess I mixed up. My bad, not moving OneTimeTrigger but moving ContinuousTrigger. Let me enumerate necessary changes from what I understand:\r\n\r\n* `OneTimeTrigger` is already in `Triggers.scala` but it's open to `public`, so need to add deprecation and plan to hide it.\r\n  * I guess adding `private[sql]` would work since Triggers.scala is already in `sql.execution.streaming` package. Not sure exact package of `sql.execution` will be hidden.\r\n  * Otherwise we can add replacement as same as what we do for ProcessingTime, but requires bigger changeset.\r\n* Move `ContinuousTrigger` to `Triggers.scala` with `private[sql]` scope, and deprecate origin.\r\n\r\nI guess both moving and deprecating make the changeset looking verbose, but I guess even in major release we may not want to remove public classes which haven't been deprecated.\r\n\r\nI guess my commit (https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/commit/f8488cfb0a045806e125215b933fc10931b1b431) mentioned above already covered it, so please take a look at the commit.
