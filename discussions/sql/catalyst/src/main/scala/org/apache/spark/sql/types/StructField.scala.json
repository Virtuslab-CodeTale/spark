However, having toString produce runnable code here has a real use-case for users.  Users can inferSchema, get the generated schema code, tweak it as needed, and then provide the schema in the future.  I've needed this many times in my projects.  I'll make sure I add this to the PR comment.  And also open a JIRA.",
