        "body" : "I believe any place including this one when we need a duration (in seconds or its fractions). The difference between `months_between()` and this place is `months_between` uses month length to calculate fraction of month, and 28 or 31 days per months don't really matter because it impacts on 2nd or 3rd digit in fractions but here we operate on bigger numbers when months _form_ years. And it becomes matter how much days we use per year. Let's say we calculate the duration of 10 years which 120 months. If we use 31 days per months, this duration is 31 * 120 = 10 * 372 = 3720 days but if one year is 365.2425 than 10 years = 3652 days. The difference is 3720 - 3652 = 68 days or the calculation error is more than 2 months. That's matter I believe. ",

Not that it means the semantics don't matter, it's just quite a corner case.\r\n\r\nI therefore just don't feel strongly either way about it. We don't need to match `months_between` semantics. More precision is nice, but surely it almost never comes up anyway? I don't mind the change, as a result. ",
