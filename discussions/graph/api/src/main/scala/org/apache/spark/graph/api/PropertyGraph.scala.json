The [Databricks Scala Style Guide](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#linelength) mentions that more than 100 chars are fine for URLs, but scalastyle still complains. Probably because it's behind an `@see` tag. I re-added it and let's see what CI says.",

AFAIK, Apache Spark community decided by VOTE.\r\n> Databricks and Neo4j contributors have proposed to integrate the openCypher language into Apache Spark 3.0 to become a central piece of a new graph module in Apache Spark 3.0, driven through the openCypher project Cypher for Apache Spark\r\n\r\nEspecially, @mengxr already told us that he is an individual to work on this. So, if you want to keep this link, you must remove the announce on the site. In general, I know that it's beyond of this PR scope, so, you can remove this link from the PR for now.",
