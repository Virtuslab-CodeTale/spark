        "body" : "Personally, I would still be okay with workerLost being an Option[String] instead of a Boolean. Obviously, had it been called \"workerIsLost\" then we would have to rename it. But I am also fine with the new name workerHost as well. I don't particularly think that the name workerLost must connote a boolean.\r\n\r\nThis ExecutorUpdated message is a case in point where the \"lost\" part is meaningful because it refers to the \"worker that is lost\" as opposed to some random worker-host. \r\n\r\nBut no strong feelings on this and I am happy with the choice workerHost.",
