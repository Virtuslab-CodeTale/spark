I'm not sure if we want to add some implementation in Spark codebase, unless the implementation of plugin proves that it works well for all possible cases.\r\n\r\nI'd rather be OK to let Spark users (including us) to be hackers and customize the scheduler with \"taking their own risks\", but I have to be conservative if we want to change the behavior of Spark. If changing the behavior of Spark to cope with state by default is the final goal, I think the behavioral change itself is a major one requiring SPIP, not something we can simply go after doing POC on happy case.",
