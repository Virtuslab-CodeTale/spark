Currently, I think the field \"reason\" is going to be duplicated in the base class ExecutorLossReason  and the ExecutorDecommission. \r\n\r\nThat's also the reason why you are pattern matching it above with an additional _ (for the `reason`) argument, when you really don't care about the `reason`.
