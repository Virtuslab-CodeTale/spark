Just thinking of someone scaling up the % of a resource and then not being able to specify more than 50% of a resource seems weird. If we do want to do this with a single type/function I'd say maybe keep it as a fraction up to but not including 1.\r\n\r\nAlso what would we do in the case a user asks for half a GPU?",

You can get performance wins when multiple spark tasks share the GPU because many times the data of 1 task is not enough to use the entire GPU and you can also overlap the copies to/from with the actual kernels running.",
