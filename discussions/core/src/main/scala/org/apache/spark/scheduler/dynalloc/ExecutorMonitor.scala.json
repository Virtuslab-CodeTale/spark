        "body" : "@dongjoon-hyun Yeah, you are right. This is not a solution but only an illustration. I wish there was a way to prevent this from bothering admins.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I enable dynamic allocation on K8s. I set `spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.timeout` to a small number so that I can kill the executors earlier but set `spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout` to a larger value since some users would like to keep their cached data around for longer. I expected the executors to be killed when the larger timeout is hit, not the smaller one, but the current behavior is the opposite. I understand different users have different requirements and this might totally make sense for them. No action is needed on your side -- I will think it through first.",
