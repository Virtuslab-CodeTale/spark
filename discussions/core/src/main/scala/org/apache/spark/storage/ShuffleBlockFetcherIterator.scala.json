But there's an exception for the corruption from `BufferReleasingInputStream`. In the case of `BufferReleasingInputStream`, the data stream has been partially consumed by the downstream RDDs. So, we don't have a chance to retry. In this case, we'd diagnose anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Previously, we'd diagnose when the block corrupted at first time. And we decide whether retry the block depends on the diagnosis result. But this way has a problem that it blocks the fetcher's thread so may introduce regression.\r\nNow, for the block corrupted at first time, we still always retry it (this remains the same behavior as now). If it corrupts again, then we'd diagnose it and throw fetch failure with the cause (if any).)",

Once a netty OOM is encountered for some responses, the corresponding requests are deferred and no more remote requests are sent. Now this helps to recover. But we don't change any in-flight remote requests limits. So after the  `isNettyOOMOnShuffle` is reset with a successful remote response, the next burst of remote requests will be sent out at the same rate. This means again there are chances to see netty OOMs and again some of the blocks will be deferred. This introduces more delay and increases the load on shuffle server.\r\n\r\nI think solving this maybe more complex and right now this is just a workaround. But maybe we can do something simpler to reduce the number of requests made after a netty OOM is encountered?\r\n",

For example, when OOM throws, the threshold would be reduced to the max number of in-flight requests before OOM. And if OOM happens again, we continue to reduce the threshold. Then, it comes to a question: when do we increase the threshold? When the backlogged requests are too much and OOM has been disappeared for a while? If we go this way, we should be very careful about the adjustment algorithm as it's directly related to the performance.\r\n\r\nLet me think more about it. Thanks!",

One such thing could be that after the OOM, we just sent the out the requests that were deferred due to the OOM and not send any additional requests. \r\nI am not sure how effective is this going to be though. Since the in-flight limit remains the same, the next call to `fetchUpToMaxBytes` when it sends out non-deferred requests can cause new blocks to OOM.\r\n\r\nAnother simple way could be to modify `isRemoteBlockFetchable` such that after this iterator has seen an OOM, it will also check `bytesInFlight + fetchReqQueue.front.size` < freeDirectorMemory?",

However, the next set of requests (including the deferred ones) will still be sent at same frequency, so some of them would again see OOMs. \r\n\r\n> Do you mean check bytesInFlight + fetchReqQueue.front.size < freeDirectorMemory for all the cases or only when isNettyOOMOnShuffle=true? \r\n\r\nI meant that if once this OOM is encountered, after that the iterator checks against freeDirectorMemory as well. If a request.size > `maxReqSizeShuffleToMem` then we can skip the check on it as that is stored on disk.\r\n",

In this case, there're still 80 deferred requests, which would hit the OOM soon as you mentioned. That being said, I think the current fix would work around the issue in the end. Note that the application would fail before the fix.\r\n\r\nTo improve the current fix further, I think we can do it in a separate PR as I think it's not an easy thing[1] to do (or do you have any other ideas?) and must require more discussion. WDTY?\r\n\r\n1. Even if we skip the case of request > maxReqSizeShuffleToMem, note that the in-memory request size is not strictly equal to the consumed memory size in Netty due to Netty's memory management mechanism (https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scalable-memory-allocation-using-jemalloc/480222803919). For example, Netty may allocate 16MB for a 9MB block.\r\nAnd there could be multiple tasks fetching concurrently. So we may need to track the total `bytesInFlight` of all tasks rather than the single task itself. And it would require more synchronization among tasks and make the thing more complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
