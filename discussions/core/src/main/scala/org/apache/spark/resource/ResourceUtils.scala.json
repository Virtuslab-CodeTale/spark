        "body" : " The ResourceProfile defines what resources the executor is supposed to have - the requirements.  4 cores, 1 GPU, 1 FPGA, etc.\r\nThe resource file is only used in standalone mode where the Worker is responsible for assigning resources to the executors.  The discovery script is used for any resources that aren't specified in the resource file.   You can actually mix them if you want - for instance in standalone mode lets say your workers know about GPUs, but not FPGA's.  The worker woudl start your executor passing a resources file with the GPU assignments, but then the executor would have to run the discovery script to find what FPGA's are available to it.\r\n\r\nThis PR isn't really changing how that is done, that is from the original accelerator aware scheduling work. This PR only changes where it gets the requirements from. Now it gets it from the ResourceProfile rather then the spark configs.\r\n\r\nSo to clarify a bit more Spark is relying on the cluster manager to assign containers with the resource you request. In the case of Standalone mode the Worker starts the executor assigning it resources via the resources file.  In the case of yarn and k8s, they just give you a container and don't tell you what resources are on it, so we use the discovery Script to find the addresses of those resources yarn/k8s gave you.",

For instance you can set spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=0.33 and what this really means is that I want 3 tasks to use the same GPU.\r\nso do that inside Spark we convert this into an amount and a number of parts per resource.  Really number of parts you can think of as the number of slots per GPU address.   For 0.33 the amount = 1 and the numparts becomes 3. If the  spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=2 the amount =2 and numparts = 1.   So numparts is the number of ways to subdivide a resource address when the amount = 1.",

Meaning executor gpus=4 and spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=2, means each task gets 2 gpus and you have 2 tasks total on that executor.\r\n\r\nIf you configure spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=4 and spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount=1 - spark throws an error as its invalid configuration.\r\n\r\nThe idea was spark.task.resource.gpu.amount acts just like spark.task.cpus - with the addition it also supports the fractional amounts in case you want to run multiple tasks on a single gpu.   \r\n",
