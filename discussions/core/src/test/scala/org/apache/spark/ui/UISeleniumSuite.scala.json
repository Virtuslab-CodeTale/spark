        "body" : "also it seems in some cases we use `exclude` for both `whitelist` as well as `blacklist`. Like here `exclude` is used for `whiteList` and [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8f414bc6b4eeb59203ecb33c26c762a57bf5429e/resource-managers/mesos/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/mesos/MesosClusterScheduler.scala#L542) for `blackList`. In general, I prefer `allowedList` for `whitelist` and `denyList` or `rejectList` or `stopList` etc for `blacklist` makes it easier to comprehend quickly. I understand its hard to use the same word everywhere because of the context.",

See the original PR #5983 for the intent.\r\n\r\nI think, rather than looking at the previous name \"whitelist\" and trying to come up with something that matches that description, we should be looking at the variable's use/purpose and asking \"what is the ideal name for this variable?\". In this case, though it was referred to as a whitelist, it was really an exclude-list or an ignored list.",
