The scenario I was thinking of was more the one where users have renamed their contexts to their own preference.  I have access to a lot of R&D clusters in my $dayjob and at times I've had as many as 10+ different contexts in my `KUBECONFIG` so I would rename contexts appropriately as some tools (GKE I'm looking at you) produce rather user unfriendly names by default.  Not sure I've ever renamed the `minikube` context itself but it's a thing that users can and might do.\r\n\r\nTL;DR If there's a naming assumption present in the code, particularly where it pertains to user managed configuration files outside of Spark's control, it should be documented as such.",

This can be selected by `minikube kubectl -- config use-context minikube`. This is only needed when after minikube is started another kubernetes context is selected.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
