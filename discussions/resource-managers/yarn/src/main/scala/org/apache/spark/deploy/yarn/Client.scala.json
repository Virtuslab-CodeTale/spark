Can we put a method like `getIvySettingsFile` into `SparkSubmit` which is leveraged in both places?\n \n Not too big of a duplication so if it can't be done cleanly no worries from my end.",

        "body" : "The assertions of file existence are slightly different in both places. In YarnClient we would want to make this assertion only for the `file` scheme before we process it, however in `SparkSubmit` we would make to make the assertion for all schemes after the appropriate download steps. E.g. for `local` scheme too we would want to validate that the final file that `loadIvySettings` will process does exist.\r\nOnce we add handling for `local` and `hdfs` schemes, the functions in both classes will differ even more. So I think it is okay to have duplication here.",
