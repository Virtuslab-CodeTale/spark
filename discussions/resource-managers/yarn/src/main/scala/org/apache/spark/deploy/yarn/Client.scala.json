Can we put a method like `getIvySettingsFile` into `SparkSubmit` which is leveraged in both places?\n \n Not too big of a duplication so if it can't be done cleanly no worries from my end.",

        "body" : "The assertions of file existence are slightly different in both places. In YarnClient we would want to make this assertion only for the `file` scheme before we process it, however in `SparkSubmit` we would make to make the assertion for all schemes after the appropriate download steps. E.g. for `local` scheme too we would want to validate that the final file that `loadIvySettings` will process does exist.\r\nOnce we add handling for `local` and `hdfs` schemes, the functions in both classes will differ even more. So I think it is okay to have duplication here.",

Given that there is already logic in place to only print the report when the status changes, this seems like a pretty low cost. We already poll the RM API to get an `ApplicationReport` once per second (by default). By comparison, this new logic will cause the `appattempts` API to get hit just a few times over the entire lifetime of the application (`ACCEPTED`, `RUNNING`, `FINISHED`). So the relative cost is very low vs. existing logic (up to hundreds or thousands of calls to get application report vs. 3-ish calls to get driver log links).\r\n\r\nThis assumes that you don't have DEBUG logging enabled. One thing we can consider is only updating the driver logs link if `lastState != state`, regardless of the log level.",
