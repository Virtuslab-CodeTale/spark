Similar to Spark UDFs and UDAFs, Hive UDFs work on a single row as input and generate a single row as output, while Hive UDAFs operate on multiple rows and return a single aggregated row as a result. In addition, Hive also supports UDTFs (User Defined Tabular Functions) that act on one row as input and return multiple rows as output. To use Hive UDFs/UDAFs/UTFs, the user should register them in Spark, and then use them in Spark SQL queries.\n\n### Examples"
