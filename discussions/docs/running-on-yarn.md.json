YARN ignores the hard-coded name on _all_ versions of YARN. Take a look at `AuxServices` on the 2.7.0 branch: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/f95b390df2ca7d599f0ad82cf6e8d980469e7abb/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/nodemanager/containermanager/AuxServices.java#L129-L136\r\n\r\n`spark.shuffle.service.name` works fine on Hadoop 2.7, it is only the isolated classloader that won't work on older versions.\r\n\r\n> I'm worrying about the situation some users try to use `Apache Spark distribution (with Hadoop 2.7)` at YARN 2.9+ cluster. Does it work?\r\n\r\nI don't quite understand the concern here. Does my explanation above address your question? We haven't changed any of the interfaces used to interact with YARN, there should be no binary compatibility issues or anything of that sort. I can test whichever combination of `Spark Version + Hadoop Version Distribution` running on top of `Hadoop Version YARN` you like, but I am failing to see where the concern is / what you'd like me to look for.",
