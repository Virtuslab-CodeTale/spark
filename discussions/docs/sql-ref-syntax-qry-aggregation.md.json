IIUC, The intention is to point to the cube, grouping sets and rollup and this is already described in group by.   So content wise we have the info in the group by page. But in terms of structure, it is easier to navigate to this from here, than from going to select and then group by page.  It is more of a landing page to get to aggregation related functionality. \r\n\r\nI can combine the 3 (CUBE, ROLLUP, GROUPING SETS)  into one bullet if that seems better?",
