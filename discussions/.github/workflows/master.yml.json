We could decide which profiles to run by default or optionally.\r\n  - provide a way to set other optional profiles, for example, via GitHub PR title or tags, which we currently does via Jenkins.\r\n- set periodical jobs for other profiles for Maven, Scala, JDK, Hive, Hadoop, etc. that we run in Jenkins, or possibly more. I think we need to resolve SPARK-32264 first to do this.\r\n\r\nCurrently `run-tests.py` runs the build for all components always if Maven is used. So, I was also thinking about fixing `run-tests.py` script to support for Maven to run tests for only relevant components just like we do for SBT, and then we only have one main job (`Build modules: ...`) that adds tests by matrix or environment control in this file rather than adding separate jobs for different profiles. \r\n\r\nI guess I am okay with this as a temporary status for the time being if we all agree with this plan. I would like to encourage us to stick to this plan in long run.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could alternatively just think about setting a Jenkins that that runs all tests too, which will ideally be converted into periodic Jenkins jobs.\r\n\r\n",
