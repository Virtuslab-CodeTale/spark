        "body" : "This commit moves to using native reader for avro files. Previously we had Decoder => GenericAvroDatumReader => AvroDeserializer. Now SparkAvroDatumReader reads directly from the Decoder. Array reading performance degraded, which has been fixed in a latter commit. Moving to the native reader also allows us to \"skip\" reading columns that are not needed. This change is also in a latter commit.\r\n\r\nRead times can be found in the attached [pdf](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/5025167/AvroBenchmarks.pdf) on pg 2 under column D.",
