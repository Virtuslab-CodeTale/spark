        "body" : "Just back from vacation and syncing. So originally I've considered to use `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` but not chosen because of the following:\r\n* `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` implements java `Map` and if we're passing that around then lot of useful features would disappear (`getOrElse`, `find`, ...) or we just have to add `asScala` to all the places where scala features are used. All in all converting forth and back was overkill from my point of view.\r\n* `KafkaBatch` is private API and though it can be different due to the considerations above.\r\n\r\nAs always if you think it worth then I can adapt...\r\n",
