        "body" : "Sorted `Seq` as key is coming from the original implementation. I understand the same way, namely different `Map` implementations or different number of buckets (this is dynamically changing when `loadFactor` reached) may end-up in different order which trigger a cache miss. The sorted `Seq` approach is one way to overcame this situation.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about to use `Map` as key but didn't change because:\r\n* To use the same `Map` implementation is not enforced on API level and I think it would be an overkill to introduce it (depending on implementation detail on class API would make the code less flexible)\r\n* Depending on implementations which provide insertion order is just error prone because multiple code places must match in terms of order and I can hardly believe devs will aware of this constraint\r\n* The only option what I see is a `Map` implementation which makes ordering in insertion time for example `TreeMap` (but considering the first point I'm not really a big fan of that).\r\n",
